                <p class='heading-primary-sub'>I'm a bit of a shut in, though my friends are always dragging me around.
                    I game on my off time, but I've lost the love that I used to have for it. Now, I enjoy going hard on
                    learning the work that we do in class. It's a challenge, and I enjoy being the one who succeeds more
                    often than not. But I'm not perfect. I forget to do things, again, more often than not. I tend to 
                    focus on one thing more than anything else. I like learning though. That's about all you're going to
                    get out of me. I'm not really a sharing type for group things either. I like being quiet. I like being
                    smart.
