The conclusion that I came to:
	1.) The work was very much tied to the work that we completed during the week.
	2.) There's always room to make the code cleaner during each iteration (sweep).
	3.) Choose your story is a great way to write a story with VBA. Python is a much more fun tool to use towards a text based adventure!
	4.) Sentence breaker helped with figuring out how to parse data in later work with the .split() command.
	5.) Hornets nest allowed me to see some very interesting ways to solve puzzles. 
	6.) The VBA script for the massive resources needed to compile data from the excel sheet is absolutely atrocious compared to Pythons ability. 
	7.) It was the if statements that allowed me to start working on the next homework. It was a lot less taxing on my RAM. 
Overall, very fun to work with and experience. I very much prefer the scripts of Python. The limitations are the many variables 
that I am using to do simple functions would be easier if they were used in loops. Sadly, I only have a limited understanding of knowledge on 
coding and am still working on cleaning up my code as well as furthering my understanding of the subject.
